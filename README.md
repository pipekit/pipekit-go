# Pipekit Go

The official [Pipekit](https://pipekit.io) golang library

## Installation

Make sure your project is using Go Modules (it will have a `go.mod` file in its
root if it already is):

``` sh
go mod init
```

Then, reference pipekit-go in a Go program with `import`:

``` go
import (
    "github.com/pipekit/pipekit-go"
)
```
